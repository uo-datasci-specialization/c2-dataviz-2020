# Overview
The purpose of this lab is to use color to your advantage. You will be asked to
use a variety of color palettes, and use color for its three main purposes: 
(a) distinguish groups from each other, (b) represent data values, and (c)
highlight particular data points.

## Data
We'll be working with the honey production data from #tidytuesday. [The repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-05-21) 
contains the full data, but we'll work with just the cleaned up version, using
the *honeyproduction.csv* file, which is posted on canvas or can be obtained by
downloading the zip file from the repo. 

# Assignment
1. Visualize the total production of honey across years by state. Use color to
highlight the west coast (Washington, Oregon, and California). Use different colors for each west coast state you highlight.
2. Reproduce the plot according three different kinds of color blindness, as
well as a desaturated version. 
3. Reproduce the plot using a color blind safe pallette. 
4. Download the file [here](https://github.com/cphalpert/census-regions/raw/master/us%20census%20bureau%20regions%20and%20divisions.csv) denoting the region and division of each state. 
  + Join the file with your honey file. 
  + Produce a bar plot displaying the average honey for each state, collapsing across years. 
  + Use color to highlight the region of the country the state is from. 
  + Note patterns you notice. 
5. Create a heatmap displaying the average honey production across years by region (averaging across states within region).
6. Create at least one more plot of your choosing using color to distinguish,
represent data values, or highlight. If you are interested in producing maps,
I would recommend joining the data with the output from `
ggplot2::map_data("state")`. But be careful with keys and that you don't end 
up with a many-to-many join. See [here](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html) 
for additional help.
